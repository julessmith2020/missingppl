                Brittney was trafficked for two years, during which time she suffered abuse and addiction. Through her hardships Brittney shows others that survival and recovery is not just possible, 
                but attainable.

                you feel like you’re worth nothing." Despite her immense burden of being trafficked, Brandi echoes her sister in her 
                inspiring words, “It takes a long time to find your self-worth and realize that you can have a life after trafficking, that it is possible.” Also a member of the Aspen House board, 
                Brandi finds that organizations like Aspen House help others to grow together, heal together, and find hope.

              <p class="text-secondary">It was hard for Jose in his young teenage years to feel appreciated and accepted for his beliefs. 
                He felt excluded. Because he could not find the love and care he was searching for by people around him, 
                Jose started searching elsewhere. Unfortunately, Jose was taken advantage of and abused for some period of time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                “I went from being a really good, really motivated student to basically failing and no one in the school 
                system asked why, or followed up.  I was young and I looked even younger and yet when I was homeless, or living with an 
                adult who was not related to me, no one really paid much attention. 
                That’s the point I really want to drive home about sex trafficking. 
                The most important part to saving victims is realizing how many different ways we could have done something before as anything
                 as horrific as to what happened to me happens to me someone else.”

              <p class="text-secondary">
                After battling questions and issues with identity during his college years, 
                James became a victim of sex trafficking of someone falsely promising to have a better life. 
                This mistreatment caused him to feel alone, isolated, worthless, and hopeless. But, after this horrible experience, 
                he actually found hope. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "When I read the stories and identified with the other survivors, I found acceptance and was willing to find a solution. 
                I was tired of feeling helpless and stuck, so I took action. I picked up the phone and I called the National Human 
                Trafficking Hotline. For the first time, I was asked to tell my story and I told it with honesty and clarity. 
                I was told that I was not alone and that others had similar experiences. I felt validated. I was given the opportunity to 
                name the man who had coaxed me into trafficking. I was also offered services and resources to help me on my healing journey. 
                Something amazing happened after that phone call. I got my power back. 
                I was finally set free and ready to move forward with my life.
                Today, I know that I am loved and I am able to love others without fear. I have found that peace that 
                I had been searching for all along. You can find that too. Today, no one has to be alone."
